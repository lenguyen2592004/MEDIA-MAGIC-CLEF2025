# Hoangwithhisfriends at MEDIQA-MAGIC 2025: DermoSegDiff and DermKEM for Comprehensive Dermatology AI

This project includes two tasks: **Skin Lesion Segmentation** and **Closed Visual Question Answering (cVQA)** for dermatological images. The segmentation task is a modified version of **DermoSegDiff**, adapted for a new dataset. The VQA task develop **DermKEM** system that enables answering questions about skin lesion images. Each task is implemented in a separate directory with its own detailed README.

Tasks

- Segmentation: Based on DermoSegDiff (MICCAI 2023 PRIME Workshop), using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for skin lesion segmentation. See [SEGMENTATION/README.md](./SEGMENTATION/README.md) for details.

- VQA: Visual Question Answering by DermKEM system for skin lesion images. See [VQA/README.md](./VQA/README.md) for details.
